> **Note:** <br/> This repo was created in November 2015 shortly after the Paris Terriorist Attacks. Facebook was filled with the profile pictures sporting the French flag filter in solidarity of the victims. However, the same support was not seen for similar attacks in Beirut, Lebanon, in November 2015, or Baghdad, Iraq in August 2015. This project stems from that, and is the reason Ethan created the sticker seen in the demo above.
